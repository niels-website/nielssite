I organised a modern folk dance festival for free next to a lake together with manon.
I borrowed a speaker from my neighbour. There were some scratches on the speaker when I returned it.
This is pretty impossible to prevent when you're moving a speaker for multiple kilometers on a bike
and in the metro. He did not care. I said i'd take the risk and pay if he wanted to. But he was okay.
I even offered him to buy whatever he was craving. But he was not craving anything.
During the festival I couldn't really connect to presence & joy because I was in the organizing mode.
Everything went well organization-wise. Managing 70 people and 2 bands is quite a thing.
