Some directions on the philosophy behind my events.

<b>Spontaneouity</b><br>
<p>Our lives are too planned and there is not a lot of space to do what you truly
want to do in the moment. To listen to the body and follow it instead of command it.
Therefore, I find it important to create events where it is possible to attend for any
amount of time. Stay for 1 minute or for 3 hours. I find it important to not have
to register or sign up. Spend less time on online forms and more time walking around outside,
by accident finding my event. I find it important that your friends can join last minute so you can
spend time with others spontaneously as well.</p><br>
<b>Free-of-charge</b><br>
<p>I find it important that you can join an event for only 5 minutes if you wish. And that you do
not have to pay 20 euros for this. I believe that joy & connection do not need a price tag.
I hope to support sustainable lifestyles by providing free events. Most people work too much and get
burned out. If at least the events are free, they will have to work less. I think the involvement of
money is not per se neccesary. I think that the energy I put into this is worthy of a reward when it
is voluntarily given. So if you want to support me, I will gratefully accept. But there is actually
no expectation or dependability on it from my side. </p>
<b>Creativity</b><br>
There is a balance between structure and creativity. I aim to honor both of them. In
general I believe that our society is too structured and that we can prosper in
an environment where we are more daring to make far-fetched connections (coming from the creativity!).
I think creativity and spiritual growth are linked in important ways. Creativity is
what is needed to transform our current limiting society. There more limits, the more creative
we need to get. <br>
<b>Trauma</b><br>
I believe in a huge traumatization of the world, individually and collectively. It is very, very
real to me. I aim to accept and integrate this into all that I do. I have a severely traumatized background myself.
I hope that I am not passing this onto anyone I teach and constantly apply critical thinking an meditation
to make sure I'm staying true.
